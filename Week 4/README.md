# Machine Learning Introduction Course: Week 4

## Overview

Welcome to Week 4 of the Machine Learning Introduction Course! This week, we will delve into the fascinating topics of anomaly detection and clustering. Additionally, we'll explore the practical aspects of solving end-to-end machine learning problems.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Clustering

In the first part of this week is clustering. Clustering involves grouping similar data points together, and it plays a vital role in various machine learning tasks, including customer segmentation, image segmentation, and recommendation systems.

#### Key Concepts:
- K-means Clustering
- Practical applications and examples

### 2. Anomaly Detection

The second major theme of this week is that we will focus on anomaly detection. Anomaly detection is a crucial aspect of machine learning, where the goal is to identify unusual patterns or data points that deviate significantly from the norm. This skill is invaluable in various real-world applications such as fraud detection, fault detection, and network security.

#### Key Concepts:
- Understanding anomalies in data
- Techniques for anomaly detection
- Real-world applications and case studies


### 3. End-to-End Machine Learning Problem

The latter part of this lesson will provide a hands-on experience in solving end-to-end machine learning problems. This section aims to integrate the knowledge gained throughout the course into a cohesive understanding of the machine learning workflow.

#### Key Components:
- Problem formulation and data preparation
- Model selection and training
- Evaluation and deployment

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Week 4, make sure you have a solid understanding of the concepts covered in the previous weeks of the course.
