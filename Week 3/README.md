# Machine Learning Introduction Course: Week 3

## Overview

Welcome to Week 3 of the Machine Learning Introduction Course! This week, we will delve into the fascinating topics of bias - variance, underfit - overfit, neural networks, decision trees, and random forests. Additionally, we'll try to train our models using the same data, and we will compare the accuracy scores.

## Topics Covered

### 1. Bias - Variance and Underfit - Overfit.

In the first part of this week, we'll explore bias, variance, underfitting, and overfitting.

#### Bias:
Bias is the error introduced by approximating a real-world problem, which may be extremely complex, by a much simpler model. It is the difference between the predicted output and the true output.

#### Variance:
Variance is the amount by which the model's prediction would change if we trained it on a different dataset. It measures the model's sensitivity to the training data.

#### Underfit:
Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture the underlying trend of the data. It results in a model that does not perform well on both the training and test data.

#### Overfit:
Overfitting happens when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, capturing noise in the data rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor generalization to new, unseen data.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** Finding the right balance between bias and variance is crucial for building a model that generalizes well to new data.
- **Regularization:** A technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term for complexity to the model's cost function.
- **Cross-Validation:** A method to assess a model's performance and generalization by splitting the data into training and validation sets.

### 2. Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and Random Forests

#### Neural Networks:
Neural networks are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. We'll explore the basics of neural networks, activation functions, and the backpropagation algorithm.

#### Decision Trees and Random Forests:
Decision trees are tree-like models that make decisions based on features of the data. Random Forests are an ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve performance and reduce overfitting.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Activation Functions:** Functions that introduce non-linearities to neural networks, enabling them to learn complex relationships.
- **Ensemble Learning:** Combining multiple models to improve overall performance and robustness.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Adjusting the parameters of a model to achieve better performance.
